# Docker-Breakout---Exploits

How can we exploit, When the container is running an image with --cap-add SYS_MODULE 

There are two files:

1) reverse-shell.c
2) makefile - make will run on the folder and compile and craete kernal module and other files

## Objective:

We are trying to listen inside the container to get a call back from kernal module since the container have SYS_MODULE capabiltiies 



```
insmod reverse-shell.ko
```
